# Report on Notepad App Development

## Introduction
The Notepad App is a simple web-based application that allows users to add, edit, and delete notes. The application also includes persistent storage using Local Storage, ensuring that notes remain available even after refreshing the page.

## Features
1. **Adding Notes**: Users can enter text into an input field and click the "Add Note" button to create a new note.
2. **Editing Notes**: Each note includes an edit button that allows users to modify the content of an existing note.
3. **Deleting Notes**: A delete button is available to remove notes when no longer needed.
4. **Persistent Storage**: Notes are stored in Local Storage, meaning they remain available even after the page is refreshed.
5. **User Interface Enhancements**: The application features hover animations for buttons, a styled interface, and tooltips for better user experience.

## Implementation Details
- The **HTML** structure includes an input field, a button to add notes, and an unordered list where notes are displayed.
- The **CSS** file provides styles for the interface, including button animations and colors.
- The **JavaScript** file handles event listeners, manages the note list, and interacts with Local Storage.

## Local Storage Integration
1. On page load, the application retrieves stored notes from Local Storage and displays them.
2. Whenever a note is added, edited, or deleted, the updated list is saved back to Local Storage.

## Conclusion
This Notepad App successfully provides a basic note-taking functionality with a clean and interactive user interface. By implementing Local Storage, users can rely on persistent note saving, making the application more practical and efficient.
